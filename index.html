    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 26, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how the application <strong>“BilimSoz”</strong> (referred to as “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and protects the personal information of users who use the application.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We value your privacy. The BilimSoz app does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal data such as name, email address, phone number, or location.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      The app operates fully offline and does not require user registration. No identifiable data is transmitted to our servers. The only data stored is related to your in-app preferences (such as favorites or language settings), which are stored locally on your device and never shared externally.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Use of Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      We do not use third-party analytics tools, advertising platforms, or external services that could collect user data.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our application is suitable for all ages and does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take your privacy seriously. Since the application does not store any personal data, there is no risk of a data breach. All data remains on your device and is never transmitted over the internet.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
